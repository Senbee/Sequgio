1) Improve BAM reading with big BAM files => Dahny Python code
2) Update C++ code for fitting PE reads
3) Merge SE & PE features in fitModels
4) make a better makeExNames program: can I guess the ex-pairing-names *before* creating them? 
   So avoid unique() afterwards
5) In reshapeTxDb some 'exons' might get smaller then probelen. Right now they are discarded but...can we merge them
   somehow?
